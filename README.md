# Endless Dodger

I built a endless game playable in browser where users dodge the objects and earn scores as my first project as beginner..

## About the Game

Endless Dodger is a browser based game built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JS. Control your rocket, dodge incoming blocks, and reach the highest score possible. The game gets progressively harder as you play.

## Features

3. Avoid the orange falling blocks

## Game Workflow

### Collision Detection
The game uses circular collision detection based on the rocket's radius and obstacle size. 

### Difficulty Scaling
- **Obstacle Speed** and  **Spawn Rate**  increases gradually with your score
- Game has a max speed limit so it doesn't become impossible

### Scoring
- 1 Point for each obstacle that safely passes below your rocket
- Best Score is tracked during play

## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers




The code is simple and easy to modify. Feel free to tweak colors, speeds, and difficulty settings and enjoy the game.



**Built with JavaScript,HTML & CSS**
